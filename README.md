DETECTING SMISHING IN MOBILE BANKING: A COMPARATIVE EVALUATION OF NAIVE BAYES AND RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHMS

ABSTRACT

The proliferation of SMS phishing (smishing) poses a significant cybersecurity threat to mobile banking, especially in regions with high mobile money usage. Effective detection is challenged by highly imbalanced datasets where spam messages are vastly outnumbered by legitimate ones (ham). This study aims to develop and evaluate robust machine learning models for smishing detection by systematically comparing the Naive Bayes and Random Forest algorithms on an imbalanced SMS dataset. The methodology involved augmenting the minority spam class using the NLPAug library to address imbalance, followed by text preprocessing and feature extraction using Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF. The models were rigorously evaluated using a comprehensive suite of metrics including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC. Result: Random Forest demonstrated superior performance with an F1-Score of 0.969, high precision (0.995), and robust recall (0.946). Naive Bayes provided a faster, baseline with an F1-Score of 0.885. The study concludes that Random Forest is the superior classifier for production environments requiring high accuracy, while Naive Bayes remains a viable option for resource-constrained scenarios. The research provides a reproducible pipeline and benchmark for building effective and efficient smishing detection systems.
